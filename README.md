## Disclaimer

This library is still at an experimental stage.
Contents may change, definitions and theorems may be renamed,
and inference mechanisms may be replaced at any major version bump.

Changes are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and
[CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md](CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md).

## Contents

This repository contains an experimental library for real analysis
for the Coq proof-assistant and using the Mathematical Components
library.

It is inspired by the [Coquelicot library]. The instantiation of the
mathematical structures of the Mathematical Components library with
the real numbers of the standard Coq library uses a well-known file
(`Rstruct.v`) from the [CoqApprox library] (with modifications from
various authors).

[Coquelicot library]: http://coquelicot.saclay.inria.fr/
[CoqApprox library]: http://tamadi.gforge.inria.fr/CoqApprox/

[ORIGINAL_FILES.md](ORIGINAL_FILES.md) gives more details about the
